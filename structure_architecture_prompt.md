# Structure & Architecture
1. **Semantic HTML5:** Strictly separate the layout into three main areas:
   - `<header>` for the navigation/top bar.
   - `<main>` to wrap the page content. Inside it, place the Hero section using `<section id="hero">`.
   - `<footer>` for the bottom area.
2. **Modularity:** Ensure every section is independent. Do not nest the Hero section inside the Header.
3. **Code Organization:** Add clear comments in both HTML and CSS (e.g., `<!-- === HEADER === -->` and `/* --- Hero Section --- */`) to visually separate these blocks.
4. **Layout:** Use a common `.container` class to align content centrally across the Header, Hero, and Footer.
